    <h1>The Deep Now</h1>
    <p>During Flow we may experience: </p>
    <p>Selflessness - Our brains switch into a different gear, which shuts down "self-criticism" as we are fully immersed in our project</p>
    <p>Timelessness - Those experiences of time dilation - "The time flew by", or time distortion - dodging bullets in the Matrix!</p>
    <p>Effortless - "Effortless effort" where it feels like our body is completely on our side  </p>
    <p>Richness - From the macro:- profound life changing moments, to the micro:- being in your element</p>

    <p class="larger">This can happen collectively too - have you ever seen a team, when they really click, or felt an electric atmosphere during a performance ?</p>
